# 🎵 Flutter Music Player App 🎶  

Welcome to my **Music Player App**, built entirely using Flutter! 🚀  
This app is a personal project aimed at learning Flutter and exploring the exciting world of mobile development. It primarily focuses on Android for now but could expand in the future. While it may not be the most optimized or polished app, it reflects my journey as a developer, and I hope you find it fascinating. 😊
